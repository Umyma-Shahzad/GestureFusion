# ✋ GestureFusion — A New Era of Gesture-Driven User Interfaces

**GestureFusion** is an interactive, real-time computer vision web application powered by Flask and OpenCV. GestureFusion allows users to explore multiple computer vision features from hand tracking to facial landmarking and gesture-based drawing all from an intuitive browser based interface.

🌟 Built as a final project for the **Computer Vision** course, GestureFusion is designed to **demonstrate real-time gesture recognition**, **dynamic image filtering**, and **intuitive visualizations** — combining the power of AI, OpenCV, and frontend development.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖌️ **Air Drawing Canvas** – Draw in the air using hand gestures
- 🌊 **Optical Flow Detection** – Visualize motion between video frames
- 🎭 **Real-Time Filters** – Apply fun and dynamic filters to your face
- 👀 **Face and Eye Detection** – Detect and track facial features
- 🔊 **Volume Control** – Adjust system volume using hand gestures
- 🖱️ **Virtual Mouse** – Control mouse pointer through gesture input

🖼️ All features run **in-browser**, using your webcam — no uploads required!
